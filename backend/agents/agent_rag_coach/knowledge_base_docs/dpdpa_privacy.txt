The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, grants individuals control over their personal data. For financial services, this means your data can only be collected with explicit consent for a specific purpose (like calculating a loan score). It must be kept secure, and you have the right to know how it's used. Your data is not shared with third parties without your permission. You have the right to access, correct, and erase your data.
