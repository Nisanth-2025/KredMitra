Source: RBI Fair Lending Practices Summary

The Reserve Bank of India's Fair Lending Practices Code emphasizes that lending decisions should be based on a holistic assessment of a borrower's repayment capacity. This includes considering alternative data sources beyond traditional credit history, especially for new-to-credit customers. The goal is to ensure non-discriminatory and transparent lending practices that promote financial inclusion. Lenders must provide clear information about terms and conditions and have a robust grievance redressal mechanism.
